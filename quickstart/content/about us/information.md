Free programming workshop for women between the ages of 18 & 100!

Build your first website with Django Girls Belfast on
**Saturday 23rd March 2019** at Puppet, Belfast!!

We want women to experience what it is like to code and work with technology. Our goal is to create a safe environment where women can explore technology.

We are trans-inclusive and welcome all women from all walks of life. Men are welcome to attend as well. We don't want men out of the IT industry, we just want more women in it.

If you are female and between the ages of 18-100 you can apply for a pass! You don’t need to know any technical stuff - it is a very informal day and we will have coaches on hand.

We do take our Code of Conduct very seriously and expect everyone in the workshop to abide to it. You can read our Code of Conduct [here](http://bit.ly/WomenInTechCoC).

You can read further information and sign up [here]({{< ref "events/march2019" >}}).
